\section*{Question 1}
Estimating the parameters for a model when considering the position of the word on top of the word itself results in a model that is too specific to achieve any sort of reasonable accuracy. It is safe to assume that the position of a word in two similar documents will be completely different due to grammar and stylistic choices by the writer. On top of that, the number of parameters needed to estimate the appropriate distribution is exponentiated by 1000 (assuming 1000 words in each document).
